        <h2>Gifts</h2>

        <p>The best present we can receive is your company and best wishes as we embark on this adventure together. We recognize, especially for those of you coming from far away, simply attending our wedding is a significant expense. Many of you are also contributing time and energy to the event and for the gift of your help we thank you.</p>

        <p>Since we’ve lived together for some time, we have most of the customary household-type items. The coziness of our small apartment also means storage space is limited.</p>

        <p>Small handmade gifts, photos, and funny memories would be wonderful. We also are grateful for any contribution towards our next travel adventure… in this case a honeymoon in Turkey.</p>

        <p>A donation to a worthwhile cause would also be a great way to acknowledge our day. Here are a few ideas:</p>
        
        </section>

        <section class="united-nations">

        <p>The United Nations High Commission for Refugees Syria Appeal (choose “give through your national office” to receive a tax receipt)</p>

        <p>The Stephen Lewis Foundation</p>

        <p>Cornerstone Housing for Women</p>

        <section class="details">

        <h2>The Details</h2>
        
        <p>The ceremony begins at 4:30 p.m. at Central Park in the Glebe, led by our Member of Parliament Paul Dewar.</p>
        
        <p>A fantastic parade follows the ceremony. This is where all of our guests move as a group from the park to the reception hall, an easy five-minute walk.</p>
        
        <p>The reception begins around 6 p.m., as soon as our parade lands us at the Glebe Community Centre. Ben and Elyse from Ottawa Streat Gourmet  will put heaps of fresh, local food on the table for everyone. Yes –there will be tacos!  David Moscrop will lead us through a series of hilarious and touching toasts. Local beer, sangria, and a selection of wines will flow all night at the open bar. And there will be lots and lots of dancing.</p>

        <section class="dress-code">

        <h2>Dress Code</h2>

        <p>Most folks will dress semi-formal, but please wear whatever makes you comfortable and happy. We’re going for a summer-dressy /garden party vibe.</p>

        <p>The ceremony will be outside in the heat of a July afternoon, so wear something cool, and bring sunscreen. We suggest you skip high heels, since they will get stuck in the grass.</p>

        <p>The reception hall is air-conditioned, so a wrap or sweater for later isn’t a bad idea.</p>
        
        </section>

        <section class="in-case">

        <h2>In case of rain</h2>

        <p>If it’s really raining, we'll move the ceremony to the Glebe Community Centre. We’ll make a call about the weather in the morning and advise  everyone by email, so if the forecast looks wet, keep an eye on your inbox.</p>
        
        </section>

        <section class="kids">

        <h2>Kids are welcome</h2>

        <p>If you’re bringing your kids, please let us know on your RSVP so we can adjust seating and find some cool toys for them to enjoy.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="dates">

        <h2>Dates are sweet – but…</h2>

        <p>This is a small event for our respective families and close friends, which means that there’s reserved space only for those named on the invitation. We guarantee you'll know someone attending and we'll do our best to make the evening fun and inclusive for everyone.</p>

        <p>While you can’t bring a date, feel free to leave with one!</p>
